            <h3>Review by Movie Hub</h3>
            <p>
                Saaho is one of the most awaited films in recent times. Post Baahubali, this is the only film that has created such a buzz in the media and general audience. Produced by UV Creations and directed by Sujeeth, this film was released in over 9000 screens worldwide. Letâ€™s now see whether the film lives up to all the hype or not.            </p>
            <p>
                The film is set in the backdrop of Waaji city which is ruled by Roy(Jackie Shroff). This does not go well with other members of the mafia and they try to eliminate Roy. During the same time, huge money is robbed from Devaraj(Chunkey Pandey) who runs the opposite gang. The cops employ an undercover cop Ashok(Prabhas) to crack this case. Who is this thief who is robbing Devaraj and his gang? What role does Ashok play in this setup?. To know this, you have to watch the film on the big screen.
            </p>
            <p>What surprises you with Saaho is the sheer scale of the film. The makers have gone all out and every penny spent is showcased wonderfully on-screen. The grandeur in fights, songs and action sequences, it is a first of its kind for Telugu cinema itself.

                Prabhas does not disappoint his fans post-Baahubali. Be it his macho screen presence or the manner in which he carries the film on his shoulders, Prabhas is pretty good and is a feast for the fans.
                
                Shraddha Kapoor makes an impressive Tollywood debut with Saaho. She is beautiful, shares superb chemistry with Prabhas and at the same time, does her action part quite convincingly.
                
                Star Bollywood actors like Jackie Shroff, Neil Nithin Mukesh play their roles in a very stylish manner. They give the film a complete edge and make it suave. Chunkey Pandey as the main villain is pretty good and does well.</p>
